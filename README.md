# Comp4008_Team21 (Pushed From GitLab: https://projects.cs.nott.ac.uk/psxpn2/comp4008_team21)
The Comp4008_Team21 project involved a collaborative effort among five students to develop a Python program for playing a new variant of the game Rummikub. As the Team Leader, I oversaw project organization, task allocation, and ensured adherence to deadlines. This document highlights my contributions to the project.

### Technical Contributions
- **Gameboard Class**: Undertook the creation of the Gameboard class, functioning as the backend representation of the gameboard. Implemented logic to validate the current state of the gameboard, returning a boolean value indicating validity, and providing the positions of tiles in invalid positions.
  
- **Computer Player Development**: Played a pivotal role in the backend and frontend development of the computer player. Wrote backend logic for the computer player to identify valid runs and groups on its rack, update existing runs and groups on the board, and visually display the computer player's moves on the frontend. I also extended the AI's capabilities into the "auto play" feature, allowing the computer to play for the user.

- **Sound Integration**: Integrated sound effects into the game using sound assets and a sound class provided by a teammate, enhancing the user experience.

- **Gameover Screen Integration**: Integrated the Gameover screen designed by a teammate with the game over backend logic.

- **Debugging**: Assisted with debugging several issues, including logical errors in validation logic, invalid positions logic, computer move generation logic, and addressing issues like circular import errors.

### Administrative Contributions

- **Project Leadership and Collaboration**: As the Team Leader for our group project, I assumed the responsibility of organizing the team's efforts, ensuring effective task distribution, and setting clear deadlines. My leadership extended to scheduling and facilitating regular team meetings, where I actively engaged with team members to encourage collaboration, listen to diverse opinions, and harness the unique talents within our group. This role required a proactive approach to guide the project seamlessly from initiation to completion.

- **Project Planning and Time Management**: Recognizing the importance of efficient project management, I strategically divided our three-week timeline into distinct phases, focusing on concurrent frontend and backend development. Emphasizing the critical role of communication, I encouraged consistent updates and feedback between team members.

- **Strategic Research and Planning**: A pivotal early phase involved dedicating approximately one week to comprehensive research and meticulous project planning. This investment in time significantly contributed to the project's overall success, fostering a smoother development process as we navigated the intricacies of game design in pygame.

- **Conflict Resolution**: During the course of the project, challenges arose, particularly stemming from miscommunication. In addressing conflicts, I exemplified patience and employed open dialogue, ensuring a thorough understanding of all perspectives. This approach facilitated compromises when necessary and maintained a positive team dynamic.
